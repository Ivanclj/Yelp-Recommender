# Yelp-Recommender
This repo is to explore using a hybrid approach to build a personalized restaurant recommendation system prototype using Yelpâ€™s dataset and LightFM package. We also compared its performance with pure collaborative filtering model and with different loss function implemented in the package. 

Dataset source: https://www.yelp.com/dataset

Github repository of LightFM: https://github.com/lyst/lightfm
